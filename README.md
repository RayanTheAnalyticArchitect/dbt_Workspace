- Created source and staging models to clean and structure raw data.
- Built analytics-ready tables and data marts.
- Wrote macros to simplify SQL logic and ensure reusability.
- Implemented generic and singular tests for data validation.
- Automated deployment and orchestration with Airflow.

## Technologies Used
